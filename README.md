## SQL Data Analytics Project 📊

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the **Advanced Analytics Layer** of a modern data warehousing solution. While the foundational data engineering is handled in my other personal project, **sql-data-warehouse-project**, this one focuses on extracting high-level business intelligence from the consolidated data.
The project transforms raw, multi-source transactional data into strategic insights using T-SQL, focusing on sales performance, customer demographics, and product trends.

---

## 🏗️ The Data Ecosystem
The analytics are built upon a structured environment that integrates data from two primary sources:
- **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**: Sales and operational data.
- **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**: Detailed customer profiles and interaction history.

Before analysis, the data undergoes a rigorous **Data Quality** process to cleanse and resolve inconsistencies, ensuring that every insight is based on a single, reliable "source of truth".

## 🎯 Objective
This project aims to help us on how to understand and cover insights about the datasets (**Exploratory Data Analysis**). We will divide the columns in Measures and Dimensions. If the values are numeric and makes sense to aggregate, then we are talking about Measures; otherwise, if isn't numeric nor makes sense to aggregate, then it is a Dimension.

- **Part-to-Whole Analysis**: Analyze how an individual part is performing compared to the overall, allowing to understand which category has the greatest
impact on the business.
- **Ranking Analysis**: Order the values of Dimensions based on Measures in order to identify the top performers and as well, the bottom performers.
- **Magnitude Analysis**: Compare the measures values across different categories and dimensions in order to help us understand the importance of different categories.
- **Measures Exploration**: Calculate and find out the key metrics of the business (Big Numbers).
- **Change-Over-Time**: Analyze how a measure evolves over the time, and it is impotant in order to track the trends and identify seasonality in the data.

### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**
- **Country Performance**

**And So On**

## 🚀 How to Use

To get started, you need to have Microsoft SQL Server installed. Then, you must clone the Data Warehouse that I 
have built as another Personal Project in this link [here](https://github.com/Ghesker-afk/sql-data-warehouse-project.git).

Read the documents of the project. Then, clone the scripts of the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghesker-afk/sql-data-analytics.git
```

- Open your Microsoft SQL Server
- Navigate to the scripts directory
- Execute the T-SQL / SQL files in your SQL Server environment to generate the analytical reports.
